<div id="Cokkie" class="Food">
    <p> Itachi was a hidden leaf village spy who was working under the akastsuki so as to prevent infinite tsukiyomi jutsu. Before 
        he entered the akatsuki itachi killed his family as they were attempting a co-de-ta in the hidden leaf village which would take 
        millions of lives and as a result there would be hate for his clan 
    </p>

    <p>
        Although itachi killed his father and mother along with his clan members he did leave the life of his younger sibling Sasuke in that
        masecor as sasuke was just a child and he had no hand in this civil war, moreover to itachi sasuke's life was even more precious for 
        itachi than the lives of thousands of citizens of the hidden leaf village

    <h1>THE COMPLETE STORY OF ITACHI UCHICHA</h1>
</div>



<div id="Chochos" class="Food">
<p>
Ever since itachi was born he was a sensitive child , with no friends till he was 7 and not much of a father son interaction with his father ,
 fugaku uchicha who was a great ninja and people of all the 5 great nations called him as "Fugaku the wiked eye" , altough his father was a great
 ninja he was never concidered as an appropriate person to be the 4th Hokage, this news when spreaded to the other uchicha members in the hidden leaf 
 furiated him that it was a proper signal that the top officers of the leaf were partial and they wanted to suppress the uchicha clan members.
</p>
<h4>The Anbu entry</h4>
<p> After itachi grew up to become a genin his purpose of life at just the age of 7 was clear, it was to become the first Hokage who was a uchicha.
    The reason why he wanted to do this wasn't because he wanted to break the prejudice that was happening to the uchicha clan it was rather to make 
    sure that the tension among the uchicha clan and the village can be stopped and also to stop any further great ninja war from breaking out in 
 the future.
 With this clear goal in mind itachi gave the chunin exam and was the first person in the hidden leaf to become a chunin at just the age of 10. After
 his win in the final round against a hidden cloud shinobi, itachi was given the offer to join the anbu , a secret organisation that worked directly
 under the Hokage.
 When this offer news was heard amongst the uchicha members everyone wanted itachi to join the anbu member but as a spy for the uchicha clan at
 the center of administration in the hidden leaf village.
